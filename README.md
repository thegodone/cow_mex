# cow_mex
This is a partial mex version of the matlab made by
Guillaume GODIN & Addisalem SHIFERAW
of the original code COW (Correlation Optimized Warping) from:

http://www.models.life.ku.dk/DTW_COW

Giorgio Tomasi, Thomas Skov and Frans van den Berg

this also include the https://gist.github.com/mathsam/5945428 
nakeinterp1 mex code

compilation on mac / windows tested simply run those 2 commands if the testCow failed on you computer:

mex cowc_mex.cpp
mex nakeinterp1.c

you may need to setup your mex environment first.

Guillaume
